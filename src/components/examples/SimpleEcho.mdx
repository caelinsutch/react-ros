## Getting Started

Throughout these examples we will assume you've already gone through the process of installing [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) or [ROS2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/) and have a [ROS websocket server](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite) running and available to connect with.

The first step in connecting ROS with a website will always be establishing a connection. With `react-ros`, we make this easy by providing a very simple and easy-to-use context provider called `useROS` to get you started.

## Connect to ROS

Here is an example of how you can use the `useROS` component and connect your website to your robot!  In this example we provide a `ToggleConnect` component that uses the `useROS` context provider to quickly and easily integrate ROS into any button or status indicator you could want to use.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { useROS } from 'react-ros'

function ToggleConnect() {
  const { isConnected, topics, url, toggleConnection } = useROS();

  return (
    <div>
      <p><strong>ROS url:</strong> {url}</p>
      <button onClick={ toggleConnection }>Toggle Connect</button>
      <p><strong>Status of ROS:</strong> { isConnected ? "connected" : "not connected" }</p>
      <p><strong>Topics detected:</strong></p>
      { topics.map((topic, i) => <li key={i}>    {topic.path}</li> )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ToggleConnect;
```

### ToggleConnect in use
To use the simple `ToggleConnect` component we made above, wrap it in the provided `ROS` context provider component from `react-ros` and everything should just work. Go ahead and try it live below on your robot!

**Note:** not shown in the code below is `import { ROS } from 'react-ros'` at the top of the file. This is needed in order to use the `ROS` context provider component.

 
import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { ROS } from '../ROS'

import ToggleConnect from './ToggleConnect'

<Playground>
  <ROS>
    <ToggleConnect />
  </ROS>
</Playground>


Taking the toggle example even further - once connected, you should be able to subscribe to a topic and print out messages as they are received.
